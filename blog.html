                    <h1>Top winter spots to go stargazing in Canada</h1>
                    <p>At 3.85 million square miles, Canada is <span> the second largest country</span> in the world by
                        total area.
                        Combine this with being sparsely populated and you'll find a lot of open country, a lack of
                        light pollution and therefore lots of dark sky spots.</p>

                    <p onclick="on()">The fact that Canada is home to over <span>half the world's Dark Sky Preserves
                        </span>means it's a
                        <span>stargazer's paradise! </span>

                    <li> Canada, home to vistas of all varieties, from rocky outcrops to stunning, sandy beaches, there really is some of the most beautiful locations in the world, dotted across Canada's stunning provinces. A holiday in Canada in 2021 is the perfect way to explore some of these magical locations.

                    <h3>A big trip to a small part of Atlantic Canada</h3>
                <ul>
                   
                    <li> 'West is Best' is always a statement I lived by when visiting Canada, but the opportunity to see the Canadian Maritimes was too good to pass up. This trip to Atlantic Canada would prove a little bit different as I would be travelling by train and car rather than flying, and it would only be for a few days, so there was a whole lot to see in a short space of time.

                    <li> The Rocky Mountains are a gem in the crown of Canada and there is so much to see and do here. On a holiday to Western Canada and Alaska you can choose itineraries that include exploring the Rocky Mountains and on these trips you can marvel at spectacular mountains and coastlines, hear stories about the Gold Rush and visit the beautiful coastal cities of British Columbia.

                    <li> There is going to be a fair amount of celestial activity this winter, so whether you are an amateur astronomer or just have an appreciation for a clear view of the Milky Way, heading out to see one of these events is a must. Even if you have a city hotel in Canada booked, there are plenty of spots away from the city lights where you still have a great view of the action.
