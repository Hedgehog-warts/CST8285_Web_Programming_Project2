                <h3>The most picturesque locations in Canada</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li> Canada, home to vistas of all varieties, from rocky outcrops to stunning, sandy beaches,
                        there really is some of the most beautiful locations in the world, dotted across Canada's
                        stunning provinces. A holiday in Canada in 2021 is the perfect way to explore some of these
                        magical locations. There are so many to choose from that we have narrowed down a few of our
                        favourites to give you a little insight into some of the wonderful places you could visit
                        next year.

                <h3>A big trip to a small part of Atlantic Canada</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li> 'West is Best' is always a statement I lived by when visiting Canada, but the opportunity
                        to see the Canadian Maritimes was too good to pass up. This trip to Atlantic Canada would
                        prove a little bit different as I would be travelling by train and car rather than flying,
                        and it would only be for a few days, so there was a whole lot to see in a short space of
                        time.

                <ul>

                    <li> The Rocky Mountains are a gem in the crown of Canada and there is so much to see and do
                        here. On a holiday to Western Canada and Alaska you can choose itineraries that include
                        exploring the Rocky Mountains and on these trips you can marvel at spectacular mountains and
                        coastlines, hear stories about the Gold Rush and visit the beautiful coastal cities of
                        British Columbia.

                <h3>Top winter spots to go stargazing in Canada</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li> There is going to be a fair amount of celestial activity this winter, so whether you are an
                        amateur astronomer or just have an appreciation for a clear view of the Milky Way, heading
                        out to see one of these events is a must. Even if you have a city hotel in Canada booked,
                        there are plenty of spots away from the city lights where you still have a great view of the
                        action.
